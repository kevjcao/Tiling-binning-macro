# Tiling / binning macro
 For tiling/columning images -- this macro spatially bins (n = number of bins) images in XY by generating tile (or column) ROIs.
 
 Use: 1. Use ImageJ macro to measure tiled ROIs on image stack. 2. Use matlab code to correct for drift - output ("alignedROIs") will be arrays that can be plotted in matlab or in other graphing software
